## About Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It involves working in blocks of 25 minutes, known as "pomodoros," followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four pomodoros, a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes is taken. The aim of this technique is to increase concentration and productivity by limiting distractions.
